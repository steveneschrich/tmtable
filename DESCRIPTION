Description: This package implements a temporal table, or as this package terms is, a
 time machine table. The purpose is to store changes to a table over time such that one
 can pull out data as of specific time points. To do this, the package implements a data
 frame with a few extra columns in the form of a "temporal table". This involves a 
 "ValidFrom" and "ValidTo" field for the purpose. Routines are provided to make working with
 this data structure easy. Note this is an R6 object.
